Task 3: Backup Configuration for Web Servers

Objective:
Automate backups for Apache (Sarah's server) and Nginx (Mike's server).

Steps:
1. Created backup scripts:
   - backup_apache.sh (backs up /etc/apache2/ and /var/www/html/)
   - backup_nginx.sh (backs up /etc/nginx/ and /usr/share/nginx/html/)

2. Scheduled automated backups using cron:
   - Apache: Runs every Tuesday at 12:00 AM
   - Nginx: Runs every Tuesday at 12:00 AM

3. Verified backup integrity:
   - Contents of tar.gz are checked and logged in backup_verification.log

4. Stored backups in `/backups/` with proper naming.
